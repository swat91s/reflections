When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If multiple people are collaborating on a project then it makes sense to use a common remote repository.
It is also useful if you will be using multiple systems during the course of your project as the code can 
be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
Manual pulling is useful because if git was automatically updating our local repository with the content
of the remote repository, then we might get unpleasant surprises when we are in the middle of working on a
new feature. Automatic pulling might be a problem when more than one person is working on the same project
trying to add two different features or one person adding a new feature and the other person trying to fix
a bug.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - Used to clone a repository directly onto the github servers without creating a local clone.
Clone - Used to copy the files and the tracking history of a local/remote repository onto your local machine.
Branches - Used to create a separate copy of code to work on without meddling up the original code.
If everything goes fine then we can merge it with the original code(branch).
