What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository it creates a .git hidden folder which stores all the necessary things like the config file.
We need to create a git repository in order to be able to track the status of the files and commit any desirable changes to them..
So we can use all the good things git has to offer us.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different from the working directory in the sense that it serves as a place from where things will get committed
to the repository in a single commit. It is useful to make logical commits and serves as a place where we can review the files and 
remove unnecessary ones before committing.
